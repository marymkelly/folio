First, have you ever told yourself that you’d remember some item when you go to the store, so you didn’t need to write it down, and then you forgot to get the item? Writing a shopping list may not be our favorite thing to do, but if you write the list ahead of time, you may realize other things you need, you’ll have a more complete picture of your current inventory, and it’ll save you time, money, and stress because you’ll be less likely to overlook or forget things that you then may have to double back for."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This shopping list concept can be extended to WBS.
